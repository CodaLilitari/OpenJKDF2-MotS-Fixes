## Movement, grabbing, and undo

**Fire 1** and **Fire 2** use your primary and secondary fire bindings. Ctrl and Shift are editor modifiers; binding a modifier alone to fire does not trigger editor fire actions.

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| F8 | Toggle editor / game mode |
| Normal movement and look | Walk, jump, and look around with collision |
| Double-tap Jump | Toggle flight; use two separate presses within 350 ms |
| Jump / Crouch in flight | Ascend / descend |
| Q in flight | Toggle collision |
| Home | Cycle through walkplayer positions and orientations |
| Hold Fire 2 | Grab the target; move or turn to drag it |
| Ctrl+Z | Undo |
| Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z | Redo |
| T | Use the normal chat / console binding |
| F12 | Use the normal screenshot binding |

Flight stops immediately when movement controls are released. Turning flight off restores collision. Edits that strand you outside the level preserve your position and facing direction, then enable flight without collision.

### Moving geometry

- Aim at a surface, edge, or circular vertex marker to highlight it.
- Surface dragging follows the strongest local horizontal, vertical, or normal direction.
- Vertex dragging follows connected edges and stops at the next vertex. Hold **Shift** for free movement.
- Drag a vertex onto another vertex to weld them where the resulting geometry is valid.
- The world grid is **0.0625 JK units**. Things use half that spacing.

### Extruding a face

1. Aim at the face and hold **Fire 2**.
2. Click **Fire 1** to extrude it outward by one grid unit.
3. Release Fire 2, then grab the new face to move it farther.

Hold **Shift** when clicking Fire 1 to extrude a level surface horizontally and make its far face vertical. This is useful for square tunnels from angled walls. A harmless rail-detonator effect marks the extrusion.

### Undo history

GeoSith retains **30 edits**, including geometry, materials, UVs, objects, lights, and settings. A continuous drag or group operation counts as one edit. Making a new edit after undo clears redo; loading a level resets history.

## 0 — Cleave

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Hold Fire 1, aim, then release | Preview and cut a line through a surface |
| Shift + line cleave | Cut the whole sector into two adjoining sectors |
| Middle mouse | Choose a line or polygon shape |
| Wheel | Cycle shapes |
| Shift + wheel | Adjust polygon radius |
| Ctrl + wheel | Rotate the polygon |
| Fire 1 with a polygon selected | Cut the projected outline into the surface |

Polygon outlines can extend beyond the surface: the cut is clipped to its boundary. Surface operations must respect the **24-vertex limit**.

In sector-cleave mode, Shift highlights the whole sector. Draw the cut across one of its surfaces; the two resulting convex sectors connect through an adjoin.

## 1 — Select and Clean Up

Middle mouse opens the mode menu. The wheel also switches between **Select** and **Clean Up**.

### Select

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Fire 1 | Toggle the highlighted surface, edge, or vertex in the selection |
| Double-click Fire 1 | Deselect everything |
| Hold Fire 2 | Move the selection; with no selection, grab the highlighted item |
| Fire 1 while holding Fire 2 | Extrude selected surfaces together |
| Hold Shift while aiming | Highlight adjoins instead of looking through them |
| Enter with surfaces selected | Open Surface Attributes |
| Delete on an edge or vertex | Dissolve it if the remaining geometry is valid and convex |
| Delete on a surface | Delete its sector |

Selected geometry is red. Up to 256 items can be selected. Shared corners move only once during group movement. Group extrusion requires surfaces; the new outer faces remain selected.

**Surface Attributes** includes material, U/V scale, geometry/texture/light modes, extra light, and adjoin distance. Separate checkbox dialogs edit **Surface Flags**, **Face Flags**, and **Adjoin Flags**.

Mixed values stay unchanged unless edited; `~` marks mixed flag bits. Only toggled bits apply to every selected surface. Select both sides of an adjoin to edit both sides. Apply commits one undo step; Cancel discards the draft.

### Clean Up

Aim at a surface and press **Fire 1** to simplify its entire sector.

Cleanup combines compatible coplanar faces into simpler convex patches and removes redundant vertices and edges. It preserves openings, materials, UV boundaries, flags, and adjoins. A concave wall may become several clean faces rather than one polygon.

### Create stairs

1. Start with a **six-surface sector** with horizontal floor and ceiling.
2. Select the two opposite vertical end walls: **high end first, low end second**.
3. Press **Enter** to open Surface Attributes.
4. Set **Stair steps**, then click **Create Stairs**.

The result uses visible stair wedges and an invisible **Floor + Impassable** ramp so the player walks smoothly. Creation is one undo step.

## 2 — Materials

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Middle mouse | Open the searchable material browser |
| Wheel | Cycle materials |
| Fire 1 on a surface | Apply the current material, including visible adjoins |
| Hold Fire 2 on a surface | Move its UVs by moving or turning |

The current material appears at the bottom right. Browser sections include **Models**, **Other**, **All**, and numbered level groups. Thumbnails keep their aspect ratio and use available material palettes or associated level colormaps.

World geometry uses planar UV mapping at **256 texels per JK unit**. Moving geometry changes texture repetitions instead of stretching the texture. UV offsets survive later edits and saving.

Surface-material shortcuts are also available outside tools that override them: **Shift + Fire 1** copies, **Ctrl + Fire 1** pastes, and **Shift + Fire 2** pans UVs. With the saber, Shift selects sector-cleave mode instead.

Apply a compatible colormap through **Escape → Level Header** if indexed textures show incorrect colors. The change updates the running level immediately; save to keep it. The `01` texture set normally uses `01narsh.cmp`.

## 3 — Things and frames

### Place, move, and rotate

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Middle mouse | Open the searchable template browser |
| Wheel | Cycle templates |
| Fire 1 | Place the chosen template at the aimed surface |
| Hold Fire 2 on an object | Move it |
| Hold Fire 2 on its green end circle | Rotate it |
| Shift while rotating | Allow rotation on all axes |
| Enter on an object | Open Thing Attributes |
| Delete on an object | Remove it |

Placement accounts for model bounds to reduce wall/floor overlap. A thing can still be placed when its model does not fit, provided its placement point is inside a sector.

Movement uses half the world grid. Rotation snaps to **5° increments** around the vertical axis by default. The rotation handle can be picked through a wall when its object is visible. Markers follow visible sectors; offset models such as elevators retain handles when their geometry reaches a visible room.

The browser previews textured models, sprites, or nonvisual markers. Sections include Sprites, Walkstructs, Projectiles, Pickups, Ammo, Weapon pickups, Enemies, NPC, Dark Jedi, Ships, Elevators, Ghosts, Decor, Throwable, and Other.

Objects remain still while editing and resume their template behavior during playtesting. Walkplayers are editable spawn points; moving the player does not move them. At least one walkplayer must remain.

### Add animation/path frames

1. Highlight the thing and press **Enter**.
2. Use **+** beside Numframes to add frames. The first copies the current pose; later frames start one grid unit above the previous frame.
3. Use **< / >** to choose a frame, **−** to remove it, or edit its coordinates and angles directly.
4. Click **Apply**, then use Fire 2 in the level to move its red preview or rotate its end circle.

Frames appear as translucent red copies with zero-based frame numbers. Their positions are independent of the original object. GeoSith saves native `numframes` and frame overrides and configures path movement automatically. Up to **64 frames per thing** are supported.

## 4 — Lights

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Fire 1 | Place a light in front of you |
| Hold Fire 2 on a light | Move it |
| Wheel on a light | Adjust intensity by 0.1 per notch |
| Shift + wheel on a light | Adjust range by one grid unit per notch |
| Wheel on a surface | Adjust its sector brightness by 0.05, from 0 to 1 |
| Delete on a light | Remove it |

New sectors start at **0.5 brightness**. Point lights add to that baseline without resetting it. Default light intensity is 1 and range is 4 JK units.

Lighting updates with distance, surface angle, and wall occlusion; adjoins pass light. Save Level stores editor light positions and bakes vertex intensities for ordinary gameplay.

> Vertex lighting interpolates between polygon corners. Add cleaves when you need finer lighting detail.

## 5 — Placed COGs

1. Press **middle mouse** to open Placed COGs.
2. Choose **Add COG** and find a script.
3. Select a script, then select a parameter to assign it.
4. For a thing, sector, or surface reference, the menu closes temporarily. Aim at the requested target and press **Fire 1**. **Escape** cancels the pick.
5. Click **Apply** to commit the script and its assignments as one edit.

Materials can be picked from surfaces, templates from things, and vectors from aimed surface points. Numeric and resource parameters accept typed values. COG references can point to another placed COG; **Edit value** also allows manual item numbers.

**Clear value** unassigns a reference or zeros a numeric/vector value. Local script symbols are omitted. Editor mode suspends scripts; F8 starts or restarts them for playtesting. Save Level includes the selected scripts and parameter assignments in the GOB.

## 8 — Template Creator

Press **middle mouse** to open the list of created templates.

1. Choose **New**, or select an existing custom template to edit it.
2. Choose its base from the searchable template list.
3. Use **+ Parameter** to search for a parameter and add it.
4. Enter its value. Click a `model3d` value to browse game and custom 3DOs.
5. Save the template. It appears in weapon 3's object browser immediately.

Saving with an existing custom name replaces that template. **Delete template** removes it. Remove placed things or dependent templates before deleting a template or model they use.

Custom templates support undo and multiplayer synchronization and are included when saving the level.

## 9 — 3DO Builder

Outside the builder, **Fire 1** starts a new draft. **Middle mouse** opens the custom-model library, where saved models can be edited or deleted.

The world turns blue while the active model retains its textured colors. Each primitive adds one mesh.

### Place primitives

| Control while weapon 9 is selected | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Middle mouse | Choose Box, Sphere, Cylinder, or Pyramid |
| Wheel | Cycle primitives |
| Shift + wheel | Adjust size |
| Ctrl + wheel | Rotate the primitive |
| Alt + wheel | Cycle three detail levels for spheres and cylinders |
| Fire 1 | Place the wireframe preview |

Cube vertices snap during placement. Other primitives retain their generated shape; their vertices can snap when moved later.

### Edit the model

| Tool / control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Weapon 0 | Cleave faces; cuts snap to half the world grid |
| Weapon 1 | Select and move faces, edges, or vertices |
| Weapon 2 | Paint materials or drag UVs with Fire 2 |
| Fire 1 while holding Fire 2 on a face | Extrude one grid unit along its outward normal |
| Weapon 1 + Fire 2 on the origin circle | Move the model's center point without moving its geometry |
| Shift while dragging a vertex | Allow free movement instead of following connected edges |
| Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y | Undo / redo |

Cleave endpoints are shared by adjacent faces. Moving a vertex onto a connected corner can merge them and remove collapsed faces. A stationary grab leaves the mesh unchanged; face/edge movement preserves its shape.

### Finish or save

Press **Escape** to open the naming dialog:

| Option | Result |
| --- | --- |
| **Discard** | Remove the draft; an existing library model stays unchanged |
| **Save as 3DO** | Save to the reusable model library and remove the workspace preview |
| **Save as _walkstruct** | Save the model, create a same-name `_walkstruct` template, and place it where you built it |

Editing an existing model opens a copy in front of you. Save with its original name to replace it. Save Level packages the model files, templates, and editable metadata inside the GOB.

## Overhead map

Press **Tab** to enter or leave the map. Green geometry sits on a black background with gray grid lines; selections are red. Player movement and other 3D inputs are suspended while the map is open.

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Hold Space and move the mouse | Pan |
| Wheel | Zoom around the cursor |
| Left-click a vertex or edge | Toggle selection; overlapping handles at different heights are picked together |
| Left-click inside a sector | Select the sectors beneath the cursor |
| Left-drag | Box-select sectors |
| Right-drag | Move the selection on the XY grid, keeping its height |
| Ctrl+C | Copy sectors and start an unplaced preview |
| Ctrl+V | Start another preview from the clipboard |
| Insert | Start a default six-sided-sector preview |
| Left-click during placement | Place and merge the preview |
| C | Start a sector cleave |
| Delete | Delete selected sectors, keeping at least one |
| Escape | Cancel the current preview, drawing, or cleave |
| Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y | Undo / redo |

Weapon 1 selections transfer between the 3D and map views. Moving whole sectors also moves their objects, walkplayers, frames, and lights. Copying copies sector geometry only.

### Draw a sector

1. **Shift + left-click** to place the first vertex.
2. Click to add walls. A red preview means the next wall would cross another wall or make the shape non-convex; placement is blocked there.
3. Use **Backspace** to remove the most recent vertex.
4. Click the first vertex to close an outline with at least three walls.

New sectors use the current material and are one JK unit tall, starting at the floor height of the room occupied when the map opened. Escape cancels unfinished drawing.

### Cleave selected sectors

Press **C**, then click-drag a line or click its two endpoints. The preview is yellow when it crosses selected sectors and red when it misses. Completing the line makes a vertical cut and joins the halves with adjoins. Each completed cleave is one undo step.

## Saving and level settings

Open the pause menu with **Escape**.

### Save Level

Enter a name to write a playable GOB in your game's `Episode` folder. The new-level name initially fills the save name, level title, and episode name. Header titles can later be edited independently of the filename.

Stock levels from `JK1.GOB` and `JK1MP.GOB` can be converted for editing. Saving suggests an `_edited` name and protects the stock archive names. Only the current map is exported; the original campaign archives are unchanged.

### Level Header

| Page | Settings |
| --- | --- |
| **General** | Display name, colormap, gravity, ceiling sky height, horizon distance, pixels per revolution |
| **Rendering** | Sky offsets, mipmap/LOD distances, perspective distance, Gouraud distance |
| **Intro Text** | All 20 loading-screen text lines |

Apply updates the working level; Save Level makes it persistent. Colormap changes take effect immediately, including undo. Text fields use JK's string format and cannot contain double quotes.

### Episode Editor

Edit the episode name/type and up to 64 sequence rows. Each row includes line/CD/level numbers, LEVEL or CUT type, filename, force-power grants, Goto A/B, display name, and loading text.

- **Goto −1** ends the episode; other targets must match a sequence line.
- Episode type flags are **1** for single player, **2** for multiplayer, and **8** for CTF; combine them as needed.
- The current row receives the edited geometry. Other rows reference level/cutscene files already available to the game.
- The current row's name and loading text are shared with Level Header.
- Apply is undoable. Save Level writes the episode settings; sequence changes take effect when the saved episode is loaded.

## Multiplayer editing

Use matching GeoSith releases and game resources. See [NETWORKING.md](../NETWORKING.md) for connection instructions.

- Joining clients receive the full current level, including objects, frames, lights, model/template libraries, headers, and placed scripts.
- Clients show edits immediately as previews while the host validates them.
- Accepted edits are broadcast; rejected or stale edits revert to the accepted host state.
- Undo and redo use the shared host history. Continuous drags count as one transaction.
- Incoming changes can cancel an active grab; re-grab the item to continue.
- Clients wait for pending edits before saving. Connection-cache GOBs do not replace existing episodes.

## Limits and geometry rules

| Item | Limit / behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Surface vertices | 24 maximum; operations that exceed this are rejected |
| Sector and surface storage | Grows with the level |
| Selected geometry | 256 items |
| Undo history | 30 edits |
| Path frames | 64 per thing |
| Custom 3DO library | 8 models and 16 total meshes per level |
| 3DO mesh | 64 faces and 512 face-corner vertices |
| Objects and placed COGs | Growing storage bounded by engine ID/table limits, with capacity reserved for gameplay |
| Multiplayer snapshots | 256 MiB uncompressed document / 512 MiB compressed transfer |

Sector operations preserve closed, planar, convex geometry. Overlaps are removed and shared boundaries become reciprocal adjoins. Exact intersections may remain off-grid to keep the level sealed.

Deleting a sector closes its former adjoins and relocates stranded walkplayer markers into remaining geometry. In edit mode, the player's viewpoint stays put with collision-free flight if it is left outside.

Imported stock geometry has a small rounding tolerance; newly created geometry uses stricter validation. Imported UVs, baked light, sector metadata, object paths, and script references are retained where conversion succeeds.

## Testing

The standalone tests do not require Jedi Knight resources:

```powershell
cmake -S tests -B build-tests -A x64
cmake --build build-tests --config Release
ctest --test-dir build-tests -C Release --output-on-failure
```

They cover geometry operations, networking helpers, growing storage, serialization, and GOB output.

Live-engine tests require a prepared `JK` installation:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/smoke.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/stress.ps1 -Render
```

The smoke test covers live edits and save/reload. The render stress test exercises repeated edits during rendering and collision updates. Logs are written under `build/`.


## Latest editor additions

### Terrain — weapon 7

- Select surfaces with weapon 1, then click with weapon 7 to create terrain. Surfaces can meet at different angles and span sectors.
- Fire1 raises terrain; Shift + Fire1 lowers it; Ctrl + Fire1 smooths neighboring vertices. The wheel changes brush radius.
- Each sector gets a separate model and thing, while shared seams sculpt together. Creating terrain leaves the original sector geometry unchanged.
- Middle mouse opens texture and conversion options. Delete removes the terrain group. These operations support undo.
- Save Level preserves editable terrain metadata and includes playable walkstructs with dirt footsteps.

### Selection and map editing

- Ctrl + Fire1 with weapon 1 selects whole sectors. Hold Fire2 to move selected sectors together. Enter opens sector attributes; M attempts a convex merge.
- Shift + wheel scales selected surfaces or sectors when valid.
- In map view, keys 1–6 select top, front, left, bottom, back and right views. Blue grid axes mark the world origin.
- The grid adapts to zoom, and movement snaps to the visible grid. Middle mouse opens X/Y/Z mirroring options.
- S starts a spline corridor. Click to add points, drag to adjust handles, and click the first point to close a loop. Escape or right-click finishes drawing.
- Select a spline and press Enter to set its shape, width, height, sector count and texture. Use Convert to Sectors before ordinary cleaving/extrusion. Until then, it remains editable through its spline controls.

### Materials, resources and sound

- Add resource folders or GOBs under mods. PNGs in a mod's mat folder convert to 16-bit MAT textures; fully transparent pixels retain one-bit transparency.
- Custom resources are included when saving and synchronized to joining multiplayer players.
- Weapon 2: Shift + Fire2 rotates UVs; hover an edge while rotating to align. Ctrl + Fire2 pans at half the usual texture grid size.
- Saber idle hum is muted while editing. Remote-player sound identity synchronization fixes incorrect weapon sounds.

Use the same release on all multiplayer peers (editor protocol 17).
